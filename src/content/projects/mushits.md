MuShits is a personal Android application designed as a minimalist retro terminal dashboard.  
It displays **weather**, **location**, **time**, and includes a **local music player**, all styled to resemble classic CLI and CRT displays.

The app features two visual modes (White-on-Black & Green-on-Black), a persistent music player powered by Media3 ExoPlayer, real-time weather, device-based location, and a clean monospaced UI inspired by old-school terminals.
