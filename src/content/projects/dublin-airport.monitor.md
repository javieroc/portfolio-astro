title: Dublin Airport Monitor
author: Javier Ocampo
description: RyanFail was built as a learning exercise to explore React, Tailwind, and modern frontend development by recreating the satirical concept of failbondi — originally focused on Flybondi, a low-cost airline from Argentina. This version applies the same idea to Ryanair, blending humor and data visualization in a lightweight, interactive UI.
