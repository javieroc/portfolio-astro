						In the shadows of the digital void, where ancient algorithms whisper forgotten secrets and databases guard their treasures in cryptic vaults, I have forged my path through darkness. Like a wraith-smith working in the depths of forgotten realms, I craft applications that emerge from shadow into light.
					</p>

					<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Born in the southern lands of Argentina, I honed my craft beneath the pale glow of countless screens, shaping systems from the first glyph of design to the final ritual of deployment. In time, the winds of destiny carried me across the seas to the emerald isles of Dublin, Ireland — a land of mist and code, where I now continue my journey as a full-stack sorcerer of software.
					</p>

					<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Whether forging resilient architectures, enchanting interfaces, or conjuring seamless deployments from the void, I walk the path of the software craftsman — alone, yet ever connected to the great weave of the digital realms.
					</p>

					<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
						When not weaving spells in code, you'll find me in communion with the thunderous symphonies of metal, drawing power from the darkest corners of imagination, and perpetually seeking new mysteries to unravel in the ever-expanding digital cosmos.
